Audio Transcribed: Section 3-How Chaya began her writing career-Start Time: 1:34-EndTime: 3:02:  for a while now, but how did you actually make it happen? - That's such a great question. I had wanted to write this book for a very long time because my husband and I kind of joked about it. And the running joke was that, you know, whenever our kids are really driving us crazy and they're just not listening to anything, we're asking them to do, we were choosing not to get angry and to make a joke out of it instead. And the joke was, you know, one day when these kids are all grown up, to visit them in their house, and we're going to do all the crazy stuff that they do in our house in their house. So like, we're going to eat with our mouth open at the table, not all the food, just drop where it may, things like that. And then my husband always said, you know, you should write a book about that. And I always said, oh, yeah, yeah, I'll write a book about it. And then I was working as the director of communications for a small nonprofit, and I was feeling like incredibly unfulfilled and really unhappy with the work that I was doing. It wasn't that I was bad at my job. It was just I wasn't enjoying it. It didn't bring me any gratification. And one night, I was sitting at my laptop and I realized, hey, you know, I've want to try this book for so long. And I actually threw this job, finally have the skills not to just write the book, but to illustrate it too. What if I actually did it? What if I did what I said I was going to do? And actually write this book. And so I did. And it's It's been wonderful.

Audio Transcribed: Section 5-Was writing always something you wanted to do?-Start Time: 4:47-EndTime: 6:30:  is did you always feel that writing was something you wanted to do, but it seems like you started more as I said as a joke, but did you have that talent in you or did you develop it as you were actually starting to do this career? So that's such an interesting question. I've been asked this before and I thought about it a lot and this is kind of how it came to be. I never knew that I wanted to be a writer, but I wrote a lot for work as you know in communications and in branding and marketing and product development, which are all the kind of career paths that I've had, I've had to write. And I've had to write well and creatively. And so in the back of my mind, I always thought about writing books. I always had different ideas for books, but I never really embraced that I could be a writer. And it wasn't until this, you know, joke that, and I actually wrote the book that I realized, oh, I could be a writer, and it's just exploded since then. So I already have a second book out, and I have another four in the works. So it's just kind of, I guess, always been in me, and I just wasn't able to access it. It's great to hear that you've unleashed the waterfall of creativity. And because we often hear about how important, even in this podcast with some other guest, how important it is to plan your career to line yourself up with the skills transfers. But you had the skills along, you probably didn't realize it, and you just took that upon yourself to put them into different use, which is wonderful to hear. Hi, this podcast
